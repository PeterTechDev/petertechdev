## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **QA Engineer / SDET** focused on building reliable and scalable automation frameworks.  
Currently, I'm working at **NDG Communications**, where I design and maintain Playwright-based testing frameworks across multiple web applications.  

My professional journey bridges **frontend development**, **test automation**, and **AI-driven QA innovation** — always driven by the belief that quality is not just a phase, but a mindset.  

Outside of work, I'm a husband, proud father, and a lifelong learner building the future step by step.
